Running the 3D CNN and SVM on Indian Pine Dataset

To run the 3D CNN and SVM on the Indian Pine dataset, follow the steps below:

   * Open the 3D_CNN_SVM.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

   * Update the file locations for Indian_pine_data and Indian_pine_label, which can be     found in the dataset folder.

   * Run the code for the CNN implementation. The output will be displayed.

   * Continue with the SVM implementation and see the outputs.

   * Now you can compare the performance of the 3D CNN and SVM using the outputs.
